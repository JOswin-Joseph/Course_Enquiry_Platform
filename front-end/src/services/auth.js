<h2>Cloud Computing with AWS — Complete Professional Training</h2>

<p>
The Cloud Computing with AWS Professional Training Program is a comprehensive, industry-oriented course designed to make learners fully job-ready in the world of cloud engineering. As businesses continue to migrate their infrastructure to the cloud, Amazon Web Services (AWS) has emerged as the most widely adopted cloud platform across startups, enterprises, government organizations, and Fortune 500 companies. This course takes you deep into the concepts, architecture, services, and deployment workflows that power modern cloud applications.
</p>

<p>
AWS offers more than 200 fully managed services, allowing companies to build scalable, secure, and high-performance applications without managing physical hardware. From virtual servers and global databases to serverless compute and enterprise security, AWS dominates cloud technology because of its flexibility, reliability, and cost efficiency. This training program helps you master these technologies through hands-on labs, real-world projects, practical use cases, and industry-standard cloud architecture patterns.
</p>

<p>
Whether you aim to become a Cloud Engineer, AWS Solutions Architect, DevOps Engineer, Infrastructure Specialist, or SRE (Site Reliability Engineer), this course provides the foundational and advanced knowledge required to design, deploy, and maintain modern cloud systems. You will learn how to run applications on EC2, store data with S3 and RDS, secure environments with IAM, design networks with VPC, automate workflows using Lambda, and monitor cloud applications using CloudWatch. By the end of the program, you’ll be able to confidently work with real enterprise cloud environments.
</p>

<h3>Introduction to Cloud Computing</h3>
<p>
Cloud computing has transformed how companies build and deliver technology solutions. Instead of purchasing expensive servers and maintaining data centers, businesses now rely on cloud providers like AWS to access computing resources on demand. This model offers enormous cost savings and operational advantages. Companies can quickly scale their applications up or down based on demand, deploy services globally with minimal effort, and ensure high availability without managing physical hardware.
</p>

<p>
AWS pioneered the modern cloud architecture and continues to innovate with new services across compute, storage, networking, AI, machine learning, analytics, automation, security, and content delivery. This course helps you understand the core principles behind cloud technology such as elasticity, fault tolerance, scalability, distributed computing, and event-driven architecture.
</p>

<h3>Why AWS is Important in the Modern IT World</h3>
<p>
Amazon Web Services is the market leader in cloud computing with the largest global infrastructure footprint and ecosystem. Millions of organizations rely on AWS for mission-critical applications, including Netflix, Instagram, Airbnb, NASA, Samsung, Adobe, Meta, and thousands of startups.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>More than 32% of global cloud market share</li>
  <li>Thousands of high-paying job openings each month</li>
  <li>Strong demand in DevOps, automation, AI, and big data industries</li>
  <li>Used across e-commerce, healthcare, fintech, gaming, and government sectors</li>
  <li>AWS certifications ranked among the highest paid in the world</li>
</ul>

<p>
By learning AWS, you open the door to a high-paying career with endless opportunities. Cloud skills are essential for developers, system administrators, analysts, cybersecurity professionals, and IT consultants.
</p>

<h3>Skills You Will Master</h3>
<p>
This training program ensures that you develop deep cloud knowledge through hands-on experience. Below are the major modules and skills you will learn throughout the course.
</p>

<h4>1. Compute Services — EC2, Auto Scaling, Load Balancers</h4>
<p>
This is the foundation of cloud computing. You will learn how virtual machines work, how to deploy web applications, configure networking rules, and automate scaling.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Launching and configuring Linux & Windows EC2 instances</li>

  <li>Auto Scaling Groups to handle dynamic traffic</li>
  <li>Load Balancers (Application, Network, Classic)</li>
</ul>

<p>
You will deploy real applications on EC2 and configure autoscaling to ensure high availability and performance.
</p>

<h4>2. Storage Services — S3, EBS, EFS, Glacier</h4>
<p>
AWS provides reliable and cost-efficient storage solutions for different use cases. You will learn:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><b>S3:</b> object storage for apps, backups, media files, and static website hosting</li>
  <li><b>EBS:</b> persistent storage for EC2 servers</li>
  <li><b>EFS:</b> scalable shared file storage for distributed apps</li>
  <li><b>Glacier:</b> low-cost archival storage</li>
</ul>

<p>
You will configure versioning, access policies, lifecycle rules, bucket replication, and CloudFront CDN distribution.
</p>

<h4>3. IAM — Security, Users, Access Policies</h4>
<p>
Security is the most important aspect of cloud computing. IAM ensures that only authorized users and services can access AWS resources.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>IAM users, groups, and permission policies</li>
  <li>Role-based access control</li>
  <li>Multi-Factor Authentication</li>
  <li>IAM roles for EC2, Lambda, and S3 access</li>

</ul>

<p>
You will learn how enterprises enforce secure cloud environments using IAM best practices.
</p>

<h4>4. Networking (VPC) — Subnets, Routing, Gateways, NAT, DNS</h4>
<p>
The Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) gives you full control over your cloud network. AWS allows you to define your IP ranges, create secure subnets, configure routers, and connect your data center to AWS.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Public and private subnets</li>
  <li>Internet Gateways and Route Tables</li>
